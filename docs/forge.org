* Introduction

Forge allows you to work with Git forges, such as Github and Gitlab,
from the comfort of Magit and the rest of Emacs.

Forge fetches issues, pull-requests and other data using the forge's
API and stores that in a local database.  Additionally it fetches the
pull-request references using Git.  Forge implements various features
that use this data but the database and pull-request refs can also be
used by third-party packages.

* Supported Forges and Hosts

Currently Forge supports two forges and three more forges partially.
Additionally it supports four semi-forges.  Support for more forges
and semi-forges can and will be added.

Both forges and semi-forges provide web interfaces for Git
repositories.  Forges additionally support pull-requests and issues
and make those and other information available using an API.

When a forge is only partially supported, then that means that only
the functionality that does not require the API is implemented, or
in other words, that the forge is only supported as a semi-forge.

A host is a particular instance of a forge.  For example the hosts
https://gitlab.com and https://salsa.debian.org are both instances of
the Gitlab forge.  Forge supports some well known hosts out of the box
and additional hosts can easily be supported by adding entries to the
option ~forge-alist~.

For more details about the caveats mentioned below (and some others)
also see [[*Getting Started]].

** Supported Forges
:PROPERTIES:
:NONODE: t
:END:

- Github

  Forge's support for Github can be considered the "reference
  implementation".  Support for other forges can lag behind a bit.

  Github Caveats

  - Forge uses the Github GraphQL API when possible but has to fall
    back to use the REST API in many cases because the former is still
    rather incomplete.

  - Forge depends on the ~updated_at~ field being updated when
    appropriate.  For Github pull-requests at least, that is not always
    done.

  Github Hosts

  - https://github.com

- Gitlab

  Gitlab Caveats

  - Forge cannot use Ghub's setup wizard to create the API token
    because the Gitlab API does not support doing that.

  - Forge cannot provide notifications because the Gitlab API does not
    expose those.

  Gitlab Hosts

  - https://gitlab.com
  - https://salsa.debian.org
  - https://framagit.org

** Partially Supported Forges
:PROPERTIES:
:NONODE: t
:END:

- Gitea https://gitea.io/en-us

  This is the next forge whose API will to be supported.

  Gitea Hosts

  - https://teahub.io Note that this host is in pre-alpha and that it
    is not clear whether the operators are trustworthy.  I have only
    added this to ~forge-alist~ because I couldn't find any other more
    trustworthy *and* persistent public instances but needed something
    for testing purposes.  The Gitea maintainers plan to create their
    own instance, see https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/1029.
    Once that is available, I will probably remove teahub.io again.

- Gogs https://gogs.io

  Once Gitea is supported it should be fairly simple to support Gogs
  too, because the former is a fork of the latter and the APIs seem to
  still be very similar.

  Gogs Hosts

  - https://code.orgmode.org

- Bitbucket

  I don't plan to support Bitbucket's API any time soon, and it gets
  less likely that I will every do it every time I look at it.

  Bitbucket Caveats

  - The API documentation is poor and initial tests indicated that the
    implementation is buggy.

  - Atlassian's offering contains two very distinct implementations
    that are both called "Bitbucket".  Forge only supports the
    implementation whose only instance is available at
    https://bitbucket.org, because I only have access to that.

  - Unlike all other forges, Bitbucket does not expose pull-requests
    as references in the upstream repository.  For that reason Forge
    actually treats it as a semi-forge, not as forge whose API is not
    supported yet.  This means that you cannot checkout pull-requests
    locally.  There is little hope that this will ever get fixed; the
    respective issue was opened six years ago and there has been no
    progress since: https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/5814.

  Bitbucket Hosts

  - https://bitbucket.org

** Supported Semi-Forges
:PROPERTIES:
:NONODE: t
:END:

- Gitweb https://git-scm.com/docs/gitweb

  Gitweb Caveats

  - I could find only one public installation
    (https://git.savannah.gnu.org), which gives users the choice
    between Gitweb and Cgit.  The latter seems more popular (not
    just on this site).

- Cgit https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about

  Cgit Caveats

  - Different sites use different URL schemata and some of the bigger
    sites use a fork.  For this reason Forge has to provide several
    classes to support different variations of Cgit and you have to
    look at their definitions to figure out which on is the correct
    one for a particular installation.

  Cgit Hosts

  - https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit
  - https://git.kernel.org
  - https://repo.or.cz

- Stgit https://codemadness.org/git/stagit/file/README.html

  Stgit Caveats

  - Stgit cannot show logs for branches beside "master".  For that
    reason Forge takes users to a page listing the branches when they
    request the log for a particular branch (even for "master" whose
    log is just one click away from there).

  Stgit Hosts

  - https://git.suckless.org

- Srht https://meta.sr.ht

  Srht Caveats

  - Srht cannot show logs for branches beside "master".  For that
    reason Forge takes users to a page listing the branches when they
    request the log for a particular branch (even for "master" whose
    log is just one click away from there).

  Srht Hosts

  - https://git.sr.ht

* Getting Started
** _ :ignore:

Getting started using Forge should be fairly easy, but there are a few
caveats you should be aware of:

- Forge uses the Ghub package to access forge APIs.  That package
  comes with a setup wizard that should make it easy to create and
  store a Github API token.  Unfortunately the same cannot be done for
  other forges and in the past it has failed for some users for Github
  too, in particular when using two-factor authentication.  See [[*Token
  Creation]] for more information.

- Fetched information is stored in a database.  The table schemata of
  that database have not been finalized yet.  Until that has happened
  it will occasionally have to be discard.  That isn't such a huge
  deal because for now the database does not contain any information
  that cannot simply be fetched again, see [[*Initial Pull]].

- Fetching is implemented under the assumption that the API can be
  asked to list the things that have changed since we last checked.
  Unfortunately the APIs are not bug-free, so this is not always the
  case.  Issues such as https://platform.github.community/t/7284 can
  take years to get addresses (in closed-source software), so I am no
  longer delaying the initial Forge release because of that.  If in
  doubt, then re-fetch an individual pull-request to ensure it is
  up-to-date using the command ~forge-pull-pullreq~.

- Some other, forge-specific, caveats are mentioned in [[*Supported
  Forges and Hosts]].

Loading Magit doesn't cause Forge to be loaded automatically.  Adding
something like this to your init file takes care of this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'magit
    (require 'forge))
#+END_SRC

Or if you use ~use-package~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package forge
    :after magit)
#+END_SRC

** Initial Pull

To start using Forge in a certain repository visit the Magit status
buffer for that repository and type ~f y~ (~forge-pull~).  Alternatively
you can use ~M-x forge-add-repository~, which makes it possible to add a
forge repository without pulling all topics and even without having to
clone the respective Git repository.

When adding the first repository from https://github.com to your local
database you will be guided through the process of creating the API
token.  For other forges as well as for other Github instances some
additional setup is required *before* you can add the first repository.
See [[*Token Creation]].

The first time ~forge-pull~ is run in a repository, an entry for that
repository is added to the database and a new value is added to the
Git variable ~remote.<remote>.fetch~, which fetches all pull-requests.
(~+refs/pull/*/head:refs/pullreqs/*~ for Github)

~forge-pull~ then fetches topics and other information using the forge's
API and pull-request references using Git.

The initial fetch can take a while but most of that is done
asynchronously.  Storing the information in the database is done
synchronously though, so there can be a noticeable hang at the end.
Subsequent fetches are much faster.

Fetching issues from Github is much faster than fetching from other
forges because making a handful of GraphQL requests is much faster
than making hundreds of REST requests.

** Token Creation

Forge uses the Ghub package to access the APIs of supported Git
forges.  Ghub comes with a setup wizard that guides the user through
the process of creating an API token for Github.com.  When accessing a
Github Enterprise instance, then some manual setup is required before
the wizard can be used.  Other forges don't support creating tokens
using the API at all.  Before accessing such a forge you have to
create a token using the respective web interface.

Please consult Ghub's manual to learn more about token creation.  See
[[info:ghub#Getting Started]] in particular.

Ghub does *not* associate a given local repository with a repository on
a forge.  The Forge package itself takes care of this.  In doing so it
ignores the Git variable ~ghub.host~ and other ~FORGE.host~ variables used
by Ghub.  (But ~github.user~ and other variables used to specify the
user are honored).  Forge associates the local repository with a forge
repository by first determining which remote is associated with the
upstream repository and then looking that up in ~forge-alist~.

If only one remote exists, then Forge uses that unconditionally.
If several remotes exist, then a remote may be selected based on its
name.

The convention is to name the upstream remote ~origin~.  If you follow
this convention, then you have to do nothing else and the remote by
that name is automatically used, provided it exists and regardless of
whether other remotes exist.  If it does not exist, then no other
remotes are tried.

If you do not follow the naming convention, then you have to inform
Forge about that by setting the Git variable ~forge.remote~ to the name
that you instead use for upstream remotes.  If this variable is set,
then Forge uses the remote by that name, if it exists, the same way
it may have used ~origin~ if the the variable were undefined.  I.e. it
does not fall through to try ~origin~ if no remote by your chosen name
exists.

Once the upstream remote has been determined, Forge looks it up in
~forge-alist~, using the host part of the URL as the key.  For example
the key for ~git@github.com:magit/forge.git~ is ~github.com~.

* Usage
** _ :ignore:

Once information has been fetched from a repository's forge, Forge
adds two additional sections named "Pull requests" and "Issues" to
Magit's status buffer.  Some of Forge's commands are only bound when
point is within one of these sections but other commands are also
available elsewhere in Magit's status buffer and/or from Magit's
transient commands.

- Key: ', forge-dispatch

  This prefix command is available in any Magit buffer and provides
  access to several of the available Forge commands.  Most of these
  commands are also bound elsewhere, but some or not.  See the
  following sections for information about the available commands.

** Pulling

The commands that fetch forge data are available from the same
transient prefix command (~magit-fetch~ on ~f~) that is used to fetch Git
data.  If option ~magit-pull-or-fetch~ is non-nil, then they are also
available from the ~magit-pull~ transient (on ~F~).

- Key: f y, forge-pull

  This command uses a forge's API to fetch topics and other
  information about the current repository and stores the fetched
  information in the database.  It also fetches notifications for all
  repositories from the same forge host.  (Currently this is limited
  to Github.)  Finally it fetches pull-request references using Git.

  After using this command for the first time in a given repository
  the status buffer for that repository always lists the pull-requests
  and issues.  See [[*Initial Pull]].

- Key: f Y, forge-pull-notifications

  This command uses a forge's API to fetch all notifications from that
  forge, including but not limited to the notifications for the current
  repository.

  Fetching all notifications fetches associated topics even if you
  have not started fetching *all* topics for the respective repositories
  (using ~forge-pull~), but it does not cause the topics to be listed in
  the status buffer of such "uninitialized" repositories.

Note how pulling data from a forge's API works the same way as pulling
Git data does; you do it explicitly when you want to see the work done
by others.

This is less disruptive, more reliable and easier to understand than
if Forge did the pulling by itself at random intervals.  It might
however mean that you occasionally invoke a command expecting the most
recent data to be available and then having to abort to pull first.
The same can happen with Git, e.g. you might attempt to merge a branch
that you know exists but haven't actually pulled yet.

- Key: M-x forge-pull-pullreq, forge-pull-pullreq

  This command uses a forge's API to fetch a single pull-request and
  stores it in the database.

  Normally you wouldn't want to pull a single pull-request by itself,
  but due to a bug in the Github API you might sometimes have to do
  so.

  Fetching is implemented under the assumption that the API can be
  asked to list the things that have changed since we last checked.
  Unfortunately the APIs are not bug-free, so this is not always the
  case.  Issues such as https://platform.github.community/t/7284 can
  take years to get addresses (in closed-source software), so I am no
  longer delaying the initial Forge release because of that.  If in
  doubt, then re-fetch an individual pull-request to ensure it is
  up-to-date using this command.

** Branching

Forge provides commands for creating and checking out a new branch or
work tree from a pull-request.  These commands are available from the
same transient prefix commands as the suffix commands used to create
and check out branches and work trees in a more generic fashion
(~magit-branch~ on ~b~ and ~magit-worktree~ on ~%~).

- Key: b Y, forge-branch-pullreq

  This command creates and configures a new branch from a pull-request,
  creating and configuring a new remote if necessary.

  The name of the local branch is the same as the name of the remote
  branch that you are being asked to merge, unless the contributor
  could not be bothered to properly name the branch before opening the
  pull-request.  The most likely such case is when you are being asked
  to merge something like "fork/master" into "origin/master".  In such
  cases the local branch will be named "pr-N", where ~N~ is the
  pull-request number.

  These variables are always set by this command:

  - ~branch.<name>.pullRequest~ is set to the pull-request number.
  - ~branch.<name>.pullRequestRemote~ is set to the remote on which the
    pull-request branch is located.
  - ~branch.<name>.pushRemote~ is set to the same remote as
    ~branch.<name>.pullRequestRemote~ if that is possible, otherwise
    it is set to the upstream remote.
  - ~branch.<name>.description~ is set to the pull-request title.
  - ~branch.<name>.rebase~ is set to ~true~ because there should be no
    merge commits among the commits in a pull-request.

  This command also configures the upstream and the push-remote of the
  local branch that it creates.

  The branch against which the pull-request was opened, is always used
  as the upstream.  This makes it easy to see what commits you are
  being asked to merge in the section titled something like "Unmerged
  into origin/master".

  Like for other commands that create a branch it depends on the
  option ~magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream~ whether the remote branch
  itself or the respective local branch is used as the upstream, so
  this section may also be titled e.g. "Unmerged into master".

  When necessary and possible, then the remote pull-request branch is
  configured to be used as the push-target.  This makes it easy to see
  what further changes the contributor has made since you last
  reviewed their changes in the section titled something like
  "Unpulled from origin/new-feature" or "Unpulled from
  fork/new-feature".

  - If the pull-request branch is located in the upstream repository,
    then you probably have set ~remote.pushDefault~ to that repository.
    However some users like to set that variable to their personal
    fork, even if they have push access to the upstream, so
    ~branch.<name>.pushRemote~ is set anyway.

  - If the pull-request branch is located inside a fork, then you are
    usually able to push to that branch, because Github by default
    allows the recipient of a pull-request to push to the remote
    pull-request branch even if it is located in a fork.  The
    contributor has to explicitly disable this.

    - If you are not allowed to push to the pull-request branch on
      the fork, then a branch by the same name located in the
      upstream repository is configured as the push-target.

    - A—sadly rather common—special case is when the contributor
      didn't bother to use a dedicated branch for the pull-request.

      The most likely such case is when you are being asked to merge
      something like "fork/master" into "origin/master".  The special
      push permission mentioned above is never granted for the branch
      that is the repository's default branch, and that would almost
      certainly be the case in this scenario.

      To enable you to easily push somewhere anyway, the local branch
      is named "pr-N" (where ~N~ is the pull-request number) and the
      upstream repository is used as the push-remote.

    - Finally, if you are allowed to push to the pull-request branch
      and the contributor had the foresight to use a dedicated branch,
      then the fork is configured as the push-remote.

    The push-remote is configured using ~branch.<name>.pushRemote~, even
    if the used value is identical to that of ~remote.pushDefault~, just
    in case you change the value of the latter later on.  Additionally
    the variable ~branch.<name>.pullRequestRemote~ is set to the remote
    on which the pull-request branch is located.

- Key: b y, forge-checkout-pullreq

  This command creates and configures a new branch from a pull-request
  the same way ~forge-branch-pullreq~ does.  Additionally it checks out
  the new branch.

- Key: % y, forge-checkout-worktree

  This command creates and configures a new branch from a pull-request
  the same way ~forge-branch-pullreq~ does.  Additionally it checks out
  the new branch using a new working tree.

When you delete a pull-request branch, which was created using one of
the above three commands, then ~magit-branch-delete~ usually offers to
also delete the corresponding remote.  It does not offer to delete a
remote if (1) the remote is the upstream remote, and/or (2) if other
branches are being fetched from the remote.

Note that you have to delete the local branch (e.g. "feature") for
this to work.  If you delete the tracking branch (e.g "fork/feature"),
then the remote is never removed.

** Working with Topics
*** _ :ignore:

We call both issues and pull-requests "topics".  The contributions to
the conversation are called "posts".

*** Visiting Topics

Magit's status buffer contains lists of issues and pull-requests.
Topics are ordered by last modification time.  All open issues and
some recently edited and closed topics are listed.

Forge provides some commands that act on the listed topics.  These
commands can also be used in other contexts, such as when point is
on a commit or branch section.

- Key: C-c C-w, forge-browse-TYPE
- Key: C-c C-w, forge-browse-dwim

  These commands visit the pull-request(s), issue(s), post, branch,
  commit or remote at point in a browser.

  This is implemented using various commands named ~forge-browse-TYPE~,
  and the key binding is defined by remapping ~magit-browse-thing~ (as
  defined in ~magit-mode-map)~.  For commit sections this key is bound
  to ~forge-browse-dwim~, which prefers a topic over a branch and a
  branch over a commit.

- Key: RET, forge-visit-TYPE
- Key: C-c C-v, forge-visit-topic

  These commands visit the pull-request(s), issue(s), or repository in
  a separate buffer.

  The ~RET~ binding is only available when point is on a issue or
  pull-request section because that key is already bound to something
  else for most of Magit's own sections.  ~C-c C-v~ however is also
  available on regular commit (e.g. in a log) and branch sections.

  This is implemented using various commands named ~forge-visit-TYPE~
  and the key binding is defined by remapping ~magit-visit-thing~ (as
  defined in ~magit-mode-map~).

*** Listing Topics and Notifications

By default Forge lists a subset of topics directly in the Magit status
buffer.  It also provides commands to list topics and notifications in
separate buffers.

Forge adds the following two functions to ~magit-status-sections-hook~:

- Function: forge-insert-pullreqs

  This function inserts a list of mostly recent and/or open
  pull-requests.

- Function: forge-insert-issues

  This function inserts a list of mostly recent and/or open issues.

- User Options: forge-topic-list-limit

  This option limits the number of topics listed by the above
  functions.

  All unread topics are always shown.  If the value of this option has
  the form ~(OPEN . CLOSED)~, then the integer ~OPEN~ specifies the
  maximal number of topics and ~CLOSED~ specifies the maximal number of
  closed topics.  IF ~CLOSED~ is negative then show no closed topics
  until the command ~forge-toggle-closed-visibility~ changes the sign.

- Command: forge-toggle-closed-visibility

  This command toggles whether the above two functions list recently
  closed issues in the current buffer.

The following two functions are also suitable for
~magit-status-sections-hook~:

- Function: forge-insert-assigned-pullreqs

  This function inserts a list of open pull-requests that are assigned
  to you.

- Function: forge-insert-assigned-issues

  This function inserts a list of open issues that are assigned to
  you.

The following commands list repositories, notifications and topics in
dedicated buffers:

- Key: ' r, forge-list-repositories

  This command lists all known repositories in a separate buffer.

- Key: ' l, forge-list-notifications

  This command lists all notifications for all forges in a separate
  buffer.

- Key: ' P, forge-list-pull-requests

  This command lists the current repository's pull-requests in a
  separate buffer.

- Key: ' I, forge-list-issues

  This command lists the current repository's issues in a separate
  buffer.

- Command: forge-list-assigned-pullreqs

  This command lists the current repository's open issues that are
  assigned to you in a separate buffer.

- Command: forge-list-assigned-issues

  This command lists the current repository's open pull-requests that
  are assigned to you in a separate buffer.

*** Creating Topics

- Key: ' p, forge-create-pullreq
- Key: C-c C-n [on "Pull requests" section], forge-create-pullreq

  This command creates a new pull-request for the current repository.

- Key: ' i, forge-create-issue
- Key: C-c C-n [on "Issues" section], forge-create-pullreq

  This command creates a new issue for the current repository.

*** Editing Topics and Posts

We call both issues and pull-requests "topics".  The contributions to
the conversation are called "posts".  The post that initiated the
conversation is also called a post.

These commands are available only from the topic buffer (i.e. from the
buffer that shows the posts on a topic).  Other commands that also
work in other buffers are available here also.  For example ~C-c C-w~ on
a post visits that post in a browser.

- Key: C-c C-n, forge-create-post
- Key: C-c C-r, forge-create-post

  This command allows users to create a new post on an existing topic.
  It opens a buffer in which the user can write the post.  When the
  post is done, then the user has to submit using ~C-c C-c~.

  If the region is active and marks part of an existing post, then
  that part of the post is quoted.  Otherwise and if a prefix argument
  is used, then the complete post that point is currently on is quoted.

- Key: C-c C-e [on a post section], forge-edit-post

  This command visits an existing post in a separate buffer.  When the
  changes to the post are done, then the user has to submit using ~C-c
  C-c~.

- Key: C-c C-e [on "Title" section], forge-edit-topic-title

  This command reads a new title for an existing topic in the
  minibuffer.

- Key: C-c C-e [on "State" section], forge-edit-topic-state

  This command toggles the state of an existing topic between "open"
  and "closed".

- Key: C-c C-e [on "Labels" section], forge-edit-topic-labels

  This command reads a list of labels for an existing topic in the
  minibuffer.

- Key: C-c C-e [on "Marks" section], forge-edit-topic-marks

  This command reads a list of marks for an existing topic in the
  minibuffer.

  Marks are like labels except that they are not shared with anyone
  else.  To create a mark that topics can subsequently be marked with
  use the command ~forge-create-mark~.  Existing marks can be edited
  using the command ~forge-edit-mark~.

- Key: C-c C-e [on "Assignees" section], forge-edit-topic-assignees

  This command reads a list of assignees for an existing topic in the
  minibuffer.

- Key: C-c C-e [on "Review-Requests" section], forge-edit-topic-review-requests

  This command reads a list of people who you would like to review an
  existing topic in the minibuffer.

- Key: C-c C-k [on a post section], forge-delete-post

  This command deletes the post at point.

Creating a new post and editing an existing post are similar to
creating a new commit and editing the message of an existing commit.
In both cases the message has to be written in a separate buffer.
And then the process has to be finished or canceled using a separate
command.

The following commands are available in buffers used to edit posts:

- Key: C-c C-c, forge-post-submit

  This command submits the post that is being edited in the current
  buffer.

- Key: C-c C-k, forge-post-cancel

  This command cancels the post that is being edited in the current
  buffer.

** Miscellaneous

- Command: forge-add-repository

  This command reads a repository from the user and adds it to the
  database.  The repository can be provided as URL, as a name, or in
  the form OWNER/NAME.  This is subject to ~magit-clone-name-alist~.

  This command offers to either pull topics (now and in the future) or
  to only pull individual topics when the user invokes
  ~forge-pull-topic~.

- Command: forge-remove-repository

  This command reads a repository and remove it from the local
  database.

- Command: forge-reset-database

  This command moves the current database file to the trash and
