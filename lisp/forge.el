;;; Commentary:

;; Work with Git forges, such as Github and Gitlab, from the comfort
;; of Magit and the rest of Emacs.

;; The schema of the database has not been finalized yet.  Until that
;; has happened it will occationally have to be discarded.  For now
;; the database does not contain any information that cannot simply
;; be fetched again.
