Each entry has the form (GITHOST APIHOST ID CLASS).

GITHOST is matched against the host part of Git remote urls
  using `forge--url-regexp' to identify the forge.
APIHOST is the api endpoint of the forge's api.
ID is used to identify the forge in the local database.
CLASS is the class to be used for repository from the forge.

GITHOST and APIHOST can be changed, but ID and CLASS are final.
If you change ID, then the identity of every repository from
that forge changes.  If you change CLASS, then things start
falling apart.

There can be multiple elements that only differ in GITHOST.
Among those, the canonical element should come first.  Any
elements that have the same APIHOST must also have the same
ID, and vice-versa."

  "Return a forge repository object or nil, or signal an error.

The DEMAND argument controls what to do when the object isn't
stored in the database yet, or if it is marked as sparse.  The
valid values are:

* `nil' If the repository is stored in the database then return
  it, even if it is sparse.  Otherwise return nil.

* `t' If the repository isn't stored in the database or if the
  object is sparse, then signal an error, informing the user
  that `this-command' cannot be run until the repository has
  been pulled.

* `full' If the repository is stored in the database and the
  object isn't sparse, then return it.  Otherwise return nil.

* `stub' If the repository is stored in the database, then return
  it, regardless of whether it is sparse or not.  Otherwise create
  a new object and return it, but do not store it in the database.
  In the latter case it is assumed that the caller does not need
  the `id' and `forge-id' slots whose value differ from what they
  would be if the object were retrieved from the database.

* `create' This value is only intended to be used by commands
  that fetch data from the API.  If the repository is stored in
  the database, then return that, regardless of whether the
  object is sparse or not.  If the repository is not stored in the
  database, then make an API request to determine the ID used on
  the forge, derive our own ID from that, and store a new sparse
  object in the database and return it.

If DEMAND is t, `stub' or `create', then also signal an error if
the repository cannot be determined because there is no matching
entry in `forge-alist'.

Also update the object's `apihost', `githost' and `remote' slots
according to the respective entry in `forge-alist' and the REMOTE
argument.")
