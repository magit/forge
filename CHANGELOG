* v0.3.3    UNRELEASED

- Added ~forge-browse-remote~ to ~forge-dispatch~.  #477

- Depend on the Compat package, allowing me to use convenient features
  that were added to Emacs over the last few years, without having to
  wait another few years until everybody has updated to a reasonably
  recent Emacs release.  453c43f1

- Added support for visiting the topic reference at point.  #488

- Added ~forge-visit-topic~ to ~git-commit-mode-map~.  05529a2a

Bug fixes:

- d8773c8d, 0ca0ca8a Fix handling of JSON and YAML booleans
- 44f01370 Deal with yaml frontmatter missing title
- d04ab8f4 forge-forge.remote: Show the dynamic fallback value
- 0ebd444a #485 forge--fetch-pullreq-target-repo: Fix copy-paste error

Also contains various documentation updates, code clean-ups and
build improvements.

* v0.3.2    2022-03-07

- The command ~forge-toggle-display-in-status-buffer~ now affects all
  relevant sections. #470

- It is possible to create a pull-request from an existing issue
  again.  #473

* v0.3.1    2022-02-16

- Added several existing commands to ~forge-dispatch~.

- Added new option ~forge-add-default-sections~, which can be set to ~nil~
  to prevent Forge from adding bindings to Magit keymaps and transient
  prefix commands.

- Added new command ~forge-browse-repository~.  #443

- Added new variable ~forge-format-avatar-function~.  #447

- Added support for the ~sqlite-builtin~ and ~sqlite-module~ backends.
  See https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql/pull/86.

- Added new option ~forge-checkout-worktree-read-directory-function~.
  #463

- Also included are many other improvements, updated documentation and
  bugfixes.

* v0.3.0    2021-10-14

- Many actions that were surprisingly slow are much faster now,
  because an embarrassing bottleneck was removed in Closql v1.2.0.

- Added new option ~forge-database-connector~ allowing the use of other
  database connector libraries beside ~emacsql-sqlite~ (currently only
  ~emacsql-libsqlite3~ (experimental) and ~emacsql-sqlite3~ (discouraged)).

- Commands that take a topic or repository as argument now expect an
  object/row ID instead of an object or a number.  Objects are not
  suitable as interactive arguments because their printed
  representation would be presented to the user when using
  ~repeat-complex-command~, and because they might not reflect the
  current state when used like that.  Numbers would be more readable
  and actually meaningful to humans, but additionally they would be
  ambiguous.  Non-interactive functions continue to expect objects
  as arguments.  #368

- Some essential key bindings that were somewhat randomly selected
  during initial development have now been changed for consistency,
  which I always intended to do, but did not get around to do until
  now.  ~forge-dispatch~ is now bound to ~N~ instead of ~'~ and Forge's
  bindings in ~magit-fetch~ and ~magit-pull~ now use ~N~ and ~n~ instead of
  ~Y~ and ~y~.  ~N~ was chosen because it was one of the last alphabetic
  keys available at the top-level in Magit.  8c9614e3 et al.

- Added new command ~forge-merge~ for merging pull-requests using the
  forge's API, which I recommend you only use if someone forces you
  to do use the API.  3112aded

- Added support for following the links that some projects on Github
  display alongside issue templates.  46d5f253

- Setting the new Git variable ~forge.autoPull~ to false disables
  pulling Git data whenever API data is fetched.  This may be useful
  in active mono-repos where there is always something new (but likely
  irrelevant) to pull.  #362

- Added new commands ~forge-list-labeled-pullreqs~ and
  ~forge-list-labeled-issues~.  a3e6f8aa

- Starting with Emacs 28 ~bug-references~ is automatically configure for
  repositories cloned from many Git forges, so Forge no longer has to
  do it.  #283, #412

- It is possible to fetch only select topics of a repository, which is
  useful if that happens to be large and/or if you are only interested
  in a select few topics (such as the one you are about to open).
  ~forge-pull~ learned to fetch information about the repository itself
  even when configured to only fetch certain topics.  #382

- Added the ~forge-browse-*~ commands to ~forge-dispatch~.  #422

- Also included are several other improvements, updated documentation
  and bugfixes.
